Hi! I'm Rida, a business intelligence analyst with skills in business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. Now, I am eager to leverage my data visualization and storytelling skills to drive growth and boost sales.
In 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen BI Analyst Program. The curriculum covered business analytics, SQL, spreadsheets, data visualization and storytelling (Tableau and Power BI). 

Some facts about me:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to cook. I'm really enjoying experimenting with different flavors.
- ðŸ“· One of my favorite hobbies is photography
- âš¡ My favorite time of the year is fall</p>

Feel free to contact me on GitHub or LinkedIn!
